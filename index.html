  <h1>Grand canyon</h1>
    <p> After that we went to los vegas there we spent one night next day early morning we srated to grandcanyon 
    it was only one day trip to the canyon,  we went  to the skywalk,it was really amazing......when i stand on
    the skywalk of the Grand Canyon and look out at the horizon i felt amazed at how deep the canyon is and how
    beautifully the light plays on the canyon walls.It's no wonder the Grand Canyon is such a popular attraction,
    it's a natural wonder. </p>
